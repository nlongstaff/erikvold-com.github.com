title: The Daily UserScript: Better Mixx 'Create New Niche' Link
short URL: http://r.evold.ca/dailyus88

This userscript will create a better 'create new niche' link for <a title="Mixx" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mixx.com">Mixx</a>.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Currently, when you are on the 'Community' tab of <a title="Mixx" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mixx.com">Mixx</a> the link to create a new niche is in a 300<super>2</super>px box. Why it needs to be this huge, and not in the sub navigation where it belongs is beyond my understanding. Also it pushes the somewhat interesting information that is underneath it half way below the fold.
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/60965" title="Better Mixx Create Niche Link" rel="external" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"" UserScript</a> the massive 300<super>2</super>px box that contains the 'create new niche' link is removed and the link is added to the subnavigation of the 'Community' tab of <a title="Mixx" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mixx.com">Mixx</a>.
