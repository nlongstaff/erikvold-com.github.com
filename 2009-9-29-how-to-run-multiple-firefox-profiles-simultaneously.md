Have you ever wanted to run multiple Firefox profiles at the same time?
If so then this is a quick note on how I achieve this.
</p>
<p>
On Windows:
</p>
<div class="code">Start -&gt; Run: "%ProgramFiles%\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -no-remote -profilemanager</div>
<p>
On Mac:
</p>
<div class="code">In Terminal: /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -no-remote -profilemanager &amp;</div>
<p>
This should all be done by default in my opinion.
