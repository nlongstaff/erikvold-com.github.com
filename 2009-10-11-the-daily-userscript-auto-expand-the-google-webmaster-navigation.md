This userscript will automatically expand the Google Webmaster Tools navigation submenus.

##The Unpleasantry:

Currently you either have to memorize all of the submenus and make two clicks to get to where you want to go in [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/), or you must expand all of the submenus of the navigation manually (3 clicks), and then click the item you want. So it takes 2-4 clicks to get to where you want to go.

##The Alleviation:

Once you install the ["Google Webmaster Auto Expand The Navigation" Userscript](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/59091) the submenus will automatically be expanded, so it will only take you 1 click to get to where you want to go within the tool.
