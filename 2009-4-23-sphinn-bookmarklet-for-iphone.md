It's a bit of a hassle getting a bookmarklet on my iPhone's Safari browser without drag and drop or copy and paste, but I saw how delicious did it, and how <a rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://joemaller.com/2008/01/12/itransmogrify/">iTransmogrify</a> did it, so I thought I would make a few installation guides myself, at least until we have copy and paste. Sphinn is just the first to come.
