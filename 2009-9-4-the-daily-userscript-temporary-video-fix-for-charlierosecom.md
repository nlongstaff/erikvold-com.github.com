Since <a title="Charlie Rose" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10527">Charlie Rose's 10,527th interview video</a> on July 30th 2009, the site's videos stopped working, and there was a message displayed stating "Videos are temporarily unavailable while we migrate servers". The <a title="New York Times" rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> explained <a href="http://nytimes.com/2009/08/06/business/media/06charlie.html">"'Charlie Rose' to Appear on Bloomberg Channel"</a> on August 6th.
</p>
<p>
Well it's been 34 days now since the last Charlie Rose video was hosted on Google Video, 29 days since the New York Times article, and we are all patiently waiting for the not so tech savvy, yet content rich show to get it's website together (I'm hoping for a podcast finally). The upside while we wait is that the webmaster provided temporary wmv videos of the latest interviews, until the new Bloomberg solution is in place, the downside is that he/she/they lazily just provided a link to the video, instead of embedding the video, which forces users to download the video, open a video player, and point the video player to the downloaded file, which is a huge usability fail that I just didn't want to deal with for the last few weeks. So, I decided to address this last mistake today.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Take a look at the current process to play a temporary video:
</p><ol>
<li>Find the download link.</li>
<li>Click the download link.</li>
<li>Point the download to some folder.</li>
<li>Wait for the video to completely finish downloading...</li>
<li>Find and open a video player.</li>
<li>Point the player to the downloaded video.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/56993" title="Temporary Video Fix for Charlierose.com" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Temporary Video Fix for Charlierose.com" UserScript</a> you can forget that anything ever happened and play videos as normal.
