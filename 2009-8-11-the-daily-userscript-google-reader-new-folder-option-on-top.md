title: The Daily UserScript: Google Reader 'New Folder..' Option On Top

Today's userscript is for Google Reader users who have a lot of folders, because at some point scrolling all the way to the bottom of your folder list to get to the new folder link takes way too long. Now the link is at the top and the bottom of the list.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Take a look at the current process to add a feed to a new folder:
</p><ol>
<li>Open the feed.</li>
<li>Find and click the 'feed settings' drop down.</li>
<li>Scroll all the way to the bottom, and the longer your folder list is the pain you must suffer here.</li>
<li>Click the 'New folder...' link.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/55465" title="Google Reader 'New Folder..' Option On Top" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Google Reader 'New Folder..' Option On Top" UserScript</a> you will have the 'New folder...' link at the top of the folder list as well as the bottom, so that you are no longer forced to scroll alllll the way to the bottom of the list, and the bottom link is still there in case you need it.
