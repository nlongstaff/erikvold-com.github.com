title: The Daily UserScript: 'word:WORD' Delicious Tag For Dictionary.com
short URL: http://r.evold.ca/dailyus47
tags: UserScripts, Automation, Daily UserScript, Delicious, Productivity
---
This userscript automates a tag that I always add to bookmarks of words on dictionary.com, because it makes finding definitions for a word easy in the future.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Repeatedly typing out the tag 'word:WORD' where WORD is the actual word, and usually a long one I don't know very well and am possibly going to type wrong â€” which I do with words I know well anyhow.  
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/56746" title="Automatically Add The 'word:WORD' Tag To Delicious Bookmarks For Dictionary.com" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Automatically Add The 'word:WORD' Tag To Delicious Bookmarks For Dictionary.com" UserScript</a> is installed the 'word:WORD' tag will automatically be added for words bookmarked from Delicious.
