A law of usability doesn't exist yet, that I am aware of, but whatever it eventually is, it surely must state that Userscripts.org script pages MUST have a versions tab.
</p>
<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Take a look at the current process to view the versions of a userscript on userscripts.org:
</p><ol>
<li>Click the "Source" tab.</li>
<li>Find and click the "Versions" link (if there isn't one then there are no previous versions).</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/55651" title="Userscripts.org Script Versions Tab" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Userscripts.org Script Versions Tab" UserScript</a> you have a better option, which is to click the versions tab that now exists, as required by the still undefined law of usability.
