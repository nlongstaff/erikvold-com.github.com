This userscript will add a link to all Twitter profiles you view which will search for all tweets the mentioned/replied to the user.

##The Unpleasantry:

Take my account as an example, when I am logged in, my Twitter home page has a "@erikvold" link which will display all of the tweets that are to me or mention me, but when I browse around a user profiles [@erikvold](http://twitter.com/erikvold) there is no "@username" link, and if you want to see that information then you have to perform a search which takes time.

##The Alleviation:

Once the ["Twitter Add Replies Link To Profiles" UserScript](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/59152) is installed, then the "@username" link will be available for all of the Twitter profile pages.
