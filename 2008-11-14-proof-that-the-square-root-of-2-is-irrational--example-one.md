		<p>Assume √2 is a rational number, represented by the irreducible fraction x/y.
So we have √2 = x/y, which after squaring a multiplying by y<sup>2</sup>, becomes x<sup>2</sup> = 2y<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>This tells us that x is even, because x<sup>2</sup> is even and even*even = even and odd*odd = odd. So we can now use x=2a.</p>

<p>So now we can rewrite x<sup>2</sup> = 2y<sup>2</sup> as (2a)<sup>2</sup> = 2y<sup>2</sup>, halving both sides, we get y<sup>2</sup>=2a<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>This tells us that y<sup>2</sup> is even, which means y is even as well.</p>

<p>So, since y and x are both even, they are both divisble by 2, and thus x/y is not irredusible. This argument can then be repeated to infinity, so the assumption that √2 is a rational number is incorrect.</p>
