Well, I'm very proud to announce that <a title="Scriptish" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_target" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/">Scriptish 0.1</a> has finally been released!
</p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>

<p>
This is an event that has taken a long time to achieve, and I have had so much help from so many wonderful people that it has been a great pleasure to work on this project.
</p>

<h3>Greg Parris</h3>
<p>
<a title="supahgreg - Github" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/supahgreg">Greg</a> forked Scriptish and started contributing back in Oct '10 and he's been a constant help ever since. Greg has written <a title="Supahgreg - Scriptish commits" rel="external nofollow" target="_target" href="https://github.com/erikvold/scriptish/commits/master?author=supahgreg">plenty of code</a>, made the wiki readable, improved the usability and user experience, and no doubt has spent countless hours testing. Thank you Greg!
</p>

<h3>Olivier Cornu</h3>
<p>
<a title="ocornu - Github" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ocornu">Olivier</a> really showed me the way, he had forked Greasemonkey long before I ever started Scriptish, making a extension called Webmonkey which used Firefox 3 as the minimum supported version and taking advantage of the benefits that Firefox 3 had to offer. I pulled some code from Webmonkey and made Olivier the author (which he told me would be alright), but he really provided me with a proof by example of a simple idea, that a far better user script engine could be made by increasing the minimum supported version and taking advantage of the new features. Thank you Olivier!
</p>

<h3>Kirs Maglione</h3>
<p>
<a title="kmaglione - Github" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kmaglione">Kris</a> has helped out with some error handling contributions early on, answering more than a few of my questions on IRC, and for doing the last few reviews on AMO which I'm sure took some time. Thank you Kris!
</p>

<h3>Nils Maier</h3>
<p>
<a title="nmaier - Github" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nmaier">Nils</a> wrote some wonderful commits revamping the install window and really improving the UX of user scripts in the extension manager. I think these changes are the most visible to the average user, and are great improvements imo, so his help has been invaluable. Thank you Nils!
</p>

<h3>Dave Townsend</h3>
<p>
<a title="Mossop - Github" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Mossop">Dave</a> is one of the developers of the new Addon Manager in Firefox, and he made a restartless extension called SlipperyMonkey (<a title="SlipperyMonkey" rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://www.oxymoronical.com/blog/2010/07/How-to-extend-the-new-Add-ons-Manager">which he blogged about here</a>) showing off a bunch of Firefox 4's new features. I've pulled a lot of this code in to Scriptish, and had the pleasure to meet Dave at the 2010 Mozilla summit in Whistler when he was showing SlipperyMonkey off, and got a change for a quick ~5min QA which proved to be most helpful to me. Thank you Dave! (and thank you <a title="daviddahl - Github" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/daviddahl">David Dahl</a> for telling me to speak with him, which I might not have done).

<h3>Mozillians</h3>
<p>
A community really makes all of the difference, and I've met no better. Just look at the documentation, look at the support, look at the inspiration, and look at the goals. Thank you Mozillians!
</p>

<h3>Github</h3>
<p>
I quite honestly wouldn't have bothered spending so many unpaid hours managing a open source project without a site that helps me administrate it like Github does, because it'd just be a waste of time. Thank you Github!
