I've been wanting to start a new blog to separate my work from this website, which I'm not sure what I will do with anymore.. then I started working at Mozilla about a month ago, and now I need the new blog!  So I have started it over at <a title="Voldzilla" href="http://work.erikvold.com">work.erikvold.com</a>, I call it <a title="Voldzilla" href="http://work.erikvold.com">Voldzilla</a>.
</p>

<p>
Right now the site is ugly, really ugly, because it is very plain, and it hasn't got any content at the moment.  The content is something that I have time for, the design is going to take time.. but if you would like to help with the look and feel, or if anything at all bothers you about the site, then you can <a href="https://github.com/erikvold/erikvold.github.com">contribute here!!</a>
