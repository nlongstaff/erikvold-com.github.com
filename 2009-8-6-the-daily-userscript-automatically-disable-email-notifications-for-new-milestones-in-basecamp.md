Currently, when you create a new milestone in Basecamp, there is a check box for the option of sending an Email to the person responsible 48hrs before the milestone is due. Personally I find I uncheck the box to disable the feature far more often than I use the option, so I wrote this userscript to save myself from having to manually clicking the check box for every milestone.

<li>Find and uncheck the "Email now &amp; 48-hours before it's due" option.</li>
</ol>
