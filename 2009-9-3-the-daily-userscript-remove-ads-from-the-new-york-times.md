Have you ever been reading the newspaper and wished that you could remove all of those damn ads? well I just did for the <a title="New York Times" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://nytimes.com">New York Times</a> and it felt oh so gooood.
</p>

<p>
There were some other userscripts that did this is the past, but frankly, most did not work any longer and the few I found that did remove a portion of the ads were very badly programmed. I could not find <strong>any</strong> userscript @ <a target="_blank" title="Userscripts.org" rel="external" rev="vote-for" href="http://userscripts.org/">userscripts.org</a> that removed as many ads as the userscript I am releasing today.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Having to avoid eye contact with ads at <a title="New York Times" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://nytimes.com">nytimes.com</a>.
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/56684" title="New York Times Ads Remover" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"New York Times Ads Remover" UserScript</a> the ads will be removed after the page loads, so say goodbye to that junk.
