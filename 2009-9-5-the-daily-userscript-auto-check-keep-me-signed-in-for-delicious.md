Today's userscript deals with a small productivity issue I have with Delicious, which is having to check the 'keep me signed in' checkbox every time I sign in.

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>

Having to check the 'keep me signed in' checkbox every time I sign in.

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/56624" title="Auto Check 'Keep me signed in' for Delicious" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Auto Check 'Keep me signed in' for Delicious" UserScript</a> kiss the unpleasantry goodbye.
