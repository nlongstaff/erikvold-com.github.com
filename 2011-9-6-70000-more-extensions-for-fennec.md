Ever since I got my Android and installed Fennec I've wanted to add support for user scripts to Fennec.  <a target="_blank" title="Scriptish Supports Fennec!" rel="external" rev="vote-for" href="http://scriptish.org/news/2011/09/05/scriptish-supports-fennec.html">I'm happy to report that as of the last Scriptish release, you can install any user script on Fennec now!</a>.  So, now you can user script the mobile web to your heart's content. In fact, there's over 70,000 user scripts on <a title="Userscripts.org" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" href="userscripts.org">userscripts.org</a> alone.
