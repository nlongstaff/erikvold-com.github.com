This is just a quick annoucement of some new Ubiquity commands that I have written over the last week.

* [Backtype](http://erikvold.com/tools/ubiquity/backtype/backtype.cfm): Starts a search of [BackType](http://www.backtype.com/), which allows you to do a search for a person's comments on blogs and other sites.

* [Charlie Rose](http://erikvold.com/tools/ubiquity/charlierose/charlierose.cfm): Starts a search [Charlie Rose's Website](http://www.charlierose.com/), which is a fantastic video archive of interviews and conversations with Charlie Rose.
	
* [Inlinks-yahoo.com](http://erikvold.com/tools/ubiquity/inlinks/inlinks.cfm): Searches [Yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/) for the number of inlinks to the url provided, which can either be typed out, selected or copied, and otherwise the current page is selected.
	
* [Mixx](http://erikvold.com/tools/ubiquity/mixx/mixx.cfm): This command gives you the [Mixx](http://www.mixx.com/) (which is a lot like [Digg](http://digg.com/), but better <abbr title="In My Humble Opinion">imho</abbr>, for a lot of reasons I'll get in to one day) count of a provided url, and allows you to submit the page, or go to mixx to vote for or against the page.
	
* [Quarkbase](http://erikvold.com/tools/ubiquity/quarkbase/quarkbase.cfm): Starts a search of [Quarkbase](http://www.quarkbase.com/) for the domain provided.
