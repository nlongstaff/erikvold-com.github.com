You're wondering wtf a <a title="Personal Unblocking Code" rel="external vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Unblocking_Code">PUK</a> is right? Well I was too a couple of nights ago when my Android was asking me for it before it would let me use it, I had ten tries and went to three before I decided to stop and call Telus to ask them the question...

It turns out that telus sets a random (at least I hope it's random) PUK on your phones and never tell you what it is. They don't ask you for one when you get the phone, they don't tell you what it is or that you will need it, they don't print it on the service agreement or on the invoice, and you can't get it on the website. So when you're phone is asking you for it at 11pm and you can't call telus for help, because they're not available, then you'll have to make time to call them in the morning after they open again if you can, or call them from work if you can, or try to reach them after work before you eat dinner if you can, or after dinner if you can call before telus "support" closes, and if you can't, well, then just try again tomorrow, that's not so hard right? Of course not, so puk you very much Telus!
