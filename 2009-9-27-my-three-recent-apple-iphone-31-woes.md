title: My Three Recent Apple iPhone 3.1 Woes

Here are three iPhone issues that I recently submitted to Apple via <a title="Apple iPhone Feedback" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html">the iPhone feedback form</a>.
</p>

<h2>Problem 1</h2>
<p>
Soon after I updated my iPhone to 3.1 (which was 1-2 weeks ago) and ever since, my iPhone has randomly stops working 3x or more per day.
</p>
<p>
What I mean by "stops working" is that usually I am watching a video, turn off the screen to stick it in my pocket, at which point the audio stops (which is a huge usability fail in my opinion) so I either have to click the button on my mic to start the audio again if I am using the iPhone headphones, or I have to turn the screen back on and double click the home button to see a popup which can be used to start the audio again (another major usability fail), but since the 3.1 update when I turn off the screen the iPhone often stops working. If I click the button to turn the screen on then nothing happens, if I click the button on my headphones then nothing happens, and if I click the home button then nothing happens.
</p>
<p>
The only way to get the iPhone to work again is to press and hold the home and screen button down for ~10 secs which forces a restart.
</p>
<p>
I have to do this about 3x or more per day now on average since installing the 3.1 update.
</p>


<h2>Problem 2</h2>
<p>
This has happened twice now in the last 2 days; when I unplug my headphones to use the speakers, I get no audio, and when press the audio up and down buttons, it says 'headphones' above the volume display.. so I am assuming that it does not recognize that the head phones are missing.
</p>
<p>
Once I plug the headphones back in and remove them it again it finally works.
</p>


<h2>Problem 3</h2>
<p>
I recently moved to Victoria, Canada in what appears to be a dead zone for Rogers, so I have disabled 3g (I just use wifi here anyhow), and I have disabled automatic network selection because I'm told by Rogers support that I will be charged for data roaming if I use another network (even though I have a seperate data roaming setting disabled..), and manually selected Rogers as the Network Carrier.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that I get a 'Network Lost' alert about once every 2-5 minutes, and find watching videos and using an app impossible without clicking 'dismiss' endlessly, this is a massive usability fail in my opinion. I cannot find a way to disable this in the settings and have done some hunting online for a solution, but found nothing of value. I even tried switching the network carrier selection to automatic despite looming charges just to see if it helped, but it doesn't seem to.
