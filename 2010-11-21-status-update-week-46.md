<h2>Done</h2>
<p>It was a pretty slow week, I mainly just worked on patches for Mozilla Lab's Prospector and answering questions on the Google Analytics and Website Optimizer help forums this week.</p>
<h3>Mozilla lab's Prospector</h3>
<ul>
<li>findSuggest: Clicking a word overwrites the last word in the find field instead of replacing the existing find field (<a rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mozilla/prospector/issues/issue/33">Issue #33</a>)</li>
<li>queryStats: Bug fix for an exception when running add-on (<a rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mozilla/prospector/issues/issue/48">Issue #48</a>)</li>
<li>queryStats: failed to work and disable itself when installing by proxy file or putting xpi into extensions folder manually (<a rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mozilla/prospector/issues/issue/49">Issue #49</a>)</li>
</ul>
