I got tired of typing my username and password into Delicious all of the time, so I wrote this userscript to enable the autocomplete attribute for the login form.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Repeatedly typing username and password credentials. 
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/56623" title="Turn Delicious Login Auto Complete On" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Turn Delicious Login Auto Complete On" UserScript</a> auto complete will be enabled. This means that you will be asked to save your credentials after you provide them for the first time, and afterwards you will be able to fill them in easily.
