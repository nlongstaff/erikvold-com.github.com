title: New Comic Strips Added to the 'Comicstrip' Ubiquity Command
tags: Automation, Comics, Ubiquity
---
I've finally gotten around to updating one of my Ubiquity commands this weekend. It was perfect timing too, I think, because <a title="Comics.com" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.comics.com">comics.com</a> just recently made chages to their site, and the comics I was pulling from there stopped working. 
So I fixed this problem, but unfortunately the speed of the downloads from comics.com are pretty poor now.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that I found another site to pull some comics from, <a title="GoComics.com" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.gocomics.com">gocomics.com</a>, they have a really good selection, and a decent connection, so I added some comic strips from there. 
</p>
<p>
The total list for <a title="Ubiquity Command to View and Dump Comicstrips" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="/tools/ubiquity/comicstrip/comicstrip.cfm">comicstrip</a>, is now:
</p><ol>
<li>bc</li>
<li>betty</li>
<li>the boondocks</li>
<li>born loser</li>
<li>dilbert</li>
<li>foxtrot</li>
<li>garfield</li>
<li>get fuzzy</li>
<li>herman</li>
<li>marmaduke</li>
<li>monty</li>
<li>peanuts</li>
<li>penny arcade</li>
<li>off the mark</li>
<li>opus</li>
<li>teenage mutant ninja turtles</li>
<li>user friendly</li>
<li>wizard of id</li>
<li>working it out</li>
<li>xkcd</li>
<li>ziggy</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

Also, thanks to Russ! for adding the preview list, and the option of typing the number associated to the comic as a shortcut, they were great ideas I think.
