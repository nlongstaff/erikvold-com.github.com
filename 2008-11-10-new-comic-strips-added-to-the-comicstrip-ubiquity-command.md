title: New Comic Strips Added to the 'Comicstrip' Ubiquity Command
tags: Automation, Comics, Ubiquity
---
I've finally gotten around to updating one of my Ubiquity commands this weekend. It was perfect timing too, I think, because [Comics.com](http://www.comics.com) just recently made chages to their site, and the comics I was pulling from there stopped working. 
So I fixed this problem, but unfortunately the speed of the downloads from comics.com are pretty poor now.

The good news is that I found another site to pull some comics from, [GoComics.com](http://www.gocomics.com), they have a really good selection, and a decent connection, so I added some comic strips from there. 

The total list for <a title="Ubiquity Command to View and Dump Comicstrips" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="/tools/ubiquity/comicstrip/comicstrip.cfm">comicstrip</a>, is now: YOU DONT HAVE A LINK HERE

1. bc
2. betty
3. the boondocks
4. born loser
5. dilbert
6. foxtrot
7. garfield
8. get fuzzy
9. herman
10. marmaduke
11. monty
12. peanuts
13. penny arcade
14. off the mark
15. opus
16. teenage mutant ninja turtles
17. user friendly
18. wizard of id
19. working it out
20. xkcd
21. ziggy

Also, thanks to Russ! for adding the preview list, and the option of typing the number associated to the comic as a shortcut, they were great ideas I think.
