title: Automatically Skip Swearing to Originals on Digg with Greasemonkey

I've recently been going digg crazy with <a title="Digg / thetophat" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://digg.com/users/thetophat">my account</a>, and I love the system, but I've found one part really annoying. The step that I think needs to be removed is the "Are You Sure It's Not a Duplicate?" step, so I've written a userscript, <a title="autoSwearToOriginalDigg" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/37451">autoSwearToOriginalDigg</a>, to automatically press the "Totally original, I swear!" button, which is saving me tons of time, so I hope it saves you some time too!
