title: Automatically Skip Swearing to Originals on Digg with Greasemonkey
tags: Greasemonkey, Productivity, Analytics

I've recently been going digg crazy with [my account](http://digg.com/users/thetophat), and I love the system, but I've found one part really annoying. The step that I think needs to be removed is the "Are You Sure It's Not a Duplicate?" step, so I've written a userscript, [AutoSwearToOriginalDigg](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/37451), to automatically press the "Totally original, I swear!" button, which is saving me tons of time, so I hope it saves you some time too!
