Today's userscript is a usability improvement for <a title="Delicious" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a> to help users of this service avoid <a title="Carpal tunnel syndrome" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>.

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
When I am saving a new bookmark on delicious there are a number of suggested tags, and typically I click on a few of them, then want to start typing some tags that are not suggested. The unpleasantry is that after clicking a tag, the focus is on the clicked tag, and before typing a new tag, I must pick up the mouse and move it to the tags input field and focus on it in a suitable place, before I can start typing. I often forget to do this however, which means that I end up having to type everything twice.

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/58802" title="Delicious: Focus Tag Input Field On Clicking A Suggestion" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Delicious: Focus Tag Input Field On Clicking A Suggestion" UserScript</a> is installed, the tags input field is automatically given focus after suggested tags are clicked.
