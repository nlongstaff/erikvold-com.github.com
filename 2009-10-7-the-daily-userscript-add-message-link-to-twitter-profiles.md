Currently on all <a title="Twitter" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> user profiles have a link to directly message a user, if you can do so, but there is no link to send the user a regular tweet. That is why I wrote this userscript.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
If you are looking at a Twitter user's profile and you want to send the user a message, then you have to manually go to a page where you can send a message, remember how to spell the user's username, then you can finally type the message.
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/59259" title="Twitter Add Message Link To Profiles" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Twitter Add Message Link To Profiles" UserScript</a> there will be two links add that, when clicked, will redirect you to a page with a message started with "@<i>username</i> ". The first link is just under the user's name called "Send Message", you can't miss this one. The second is in the "Actions" section of the right navigation, which is harder to see.
</p>
<p>
Note: In the "Actions" section of the right nav, the direct message link was labeled simply 'message', if it was available/displayed to you at all, but since this is actually a direct message I decided to rename this link to 'direct msg' so that the 'message' link was freed up to be used for this userscript.
