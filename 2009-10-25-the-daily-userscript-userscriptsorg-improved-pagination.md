This userscript will improve the pagination at <a title="Userscripts.org" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="http://userscripts.org">userscripts.org</a> by adding a first and last page link which doesn't make you think.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
My main beef with the current pagination at <a title="Userscripts.org" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="http://userscripts.org">userscripts.org</a> is that there is no 'First' page and 'Last' page links at either side of the pagination, which is the convention my brain likes. When I'm tired or trying to work very quickly I can assume that this convention is being held by the site I am on.. anyways this leads to me clicking the 'Previous' and 'Next' links when I want 'First' or 'Last' and I always hate when that happens.
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/60307" title="Userscripts.org Improved Pagination" rel="external" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Userscripts.org Improved Pagination
" UserScript</a> will add 'First' and 'Last' links as described above.</p>
<p>
The userscript also adds a little more intelligence, such as shortening 'Previous' to 'Prev', collapsing two buttons into one when you are on the first or last page, and uses a "›" for 'Next' to make 'Next ›' and a "»" for 'Last' to make 'Last »' (same idea is applied to 'First' and 'Prev' links as well)
