title: The Daily UserScript: UserScripts.org Profile Link Fix
short URL: http://r.evold.ca/dailyus45
tags: Usability, UserScripts, Daily UserScript, Productivity
---Today's userscript is one that I wrote in response to a request I found at userscripts.uservoice.org which was suggesting that for logged in members that click on their profile name should go to their profile page, and not the blank member settings page.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Clicking on your member name goes to a blank member settings page from which nothing special can be done.
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/57214" title="Userscripts.org Click Your Name And Go To Your Profile" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Userscripts.org Click Your Name And Go To Your Profile" UserScript</a> you will have the desired functionality.
