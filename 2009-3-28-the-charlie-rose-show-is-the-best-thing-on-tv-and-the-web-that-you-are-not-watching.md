title: The Charlie Rose Show Is The Best Show On TV And The Web That You Are Not Watching

I've been watching every episode of <a title="Charlie Rose" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.charlierose.com/">The Charlie Rose Show</a> now for around 4 years, and when his website finally came online I dugg through hours and hours of episodes from the past which I had missed. That is how much I love this show, which is a lot more than I can say for any other TV show.
</p>
<p>
Why is this? well for me it's because the focus is not on sending sound bites of information, it is about comprehending information, which is really hard to find on TV, and better on the Web.
</p>

I have however unfortunately found that most people I mention the show to don't care for it. A friend of mine, Matt Lockyer once asked me "you like the dry conversation?" a few days after I pointed the show out to him; I thought the show was quite the opposite. I've mentioned the show to my Mother and Father as well, and they said "huh interesting..." but don't watch it. I even use social bookmarking for my favorite videos that I thought really added something to a topic of conversation I hadn't heard before, but the bookmarks are frequently voted down to 0 and below.

<p>
Anyhow, I don't think I will ever understand the people I share this planet with, but I do know that there are other viewers out there, even though I have never meet one, so luckily I am not alone. And I want to say to anyone reading this, give the Charlie Rose show a real chance, and you will not regret it, I promise you.

The show is on late though, so I recommend watching at <a title="charlierose.com" target="_blank" rev="vote-for" rel="external" href="http://charlierose.com">charlierose.com</a> when you have a chance, and don't skim past the people you don't know, those are often the best conversations.
