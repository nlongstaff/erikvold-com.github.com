[Sphinning](http://sphinn.com/) your favorite internet marketing web pages just got a lot easier with the [Sphinn command](http://erikvold.com/tools/ubiquity/sphinn/sphinn.cfm) I just wrote for [Ubiquity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity).

All you have to do is hit alt+space, type sphinn, then hit the enter key and you will submit whatever page your looking at to sphinn. You can also submit a highlighted url, or you can type the url you want to sphinn, like:

sphinn [http://www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com)

Soon I will add the ability to submit a highlighted link.
