title: Apple Mobile Device Bug, iPhone/iPod touch "recieving invalid response" error..

Well, today I woke up to a bit of a headache today. As soon as I was out of bed I tried to sync my iPhone (as always), and got an "receiving invalid response error", then I tried my iPod Touch, only to get the same error message. So, with ringing in my ears, I started a dreaded google search for the error message, and found <a title="Apple.com < Support <  Discussions < iPod touch < Connecting iPod touch to Windows" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against solution" href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1543017&amp;tstart=465">this</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I didn't want to lose my music ratings, view count, and other meta data that I've been building up for years. And I could have exported the library (and hopefully that would save the iTunes meta data), but my library is huge, so I would've had to buy another external HD, which is never a good solution to a software problem.</p>

<p>So, I simply did the following to save my library and solve the problem:
</p><ol>
<li>Uninstall "Apple Mobile Device Support" only.</li>
<li>Download the <a title="Download iTunes" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes</a> installer</li>
<li>Run the iTunes installer.</li>
</ol><p></p>

<p>Note: I was using iTunes 8.0.0.35, iPhone &amp; iPod Touch 2.1 when I received these errors, and was able to download the installer for same iTunes version.</p>
