Today's userscript is another simple one to remove ads, this time from <a title="Mixx" rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://mixx.com/">Mixx.com</a>. Even if you are using Adblock Plus or something similar to block ads from being displayed at Mixx, the space where they would be still remains, this userscript will remove those spaces that that the pages at Mixx are easier to read.

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Seeing Ads at Mixx.
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/60976" title="Mixx Ads Remover" rel="external" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Mixx Ads Remover" UserScript</a> most if not all of the ads will be removed from Mixx.
