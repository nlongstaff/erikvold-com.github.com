I'm starting a new series on using the <a target="_blank" title="Jetpack SDK" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" href="https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/">Jetpack SDK</a>, as I like to call it; you may know it as the Add-on SDK, and I wold not hold that against you ;).  I won't be talking about the <a target="_blank" title="Add-on Builder" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" href="https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/">Add-on Builder</a>, that's another topic that I will save for later.  If you are new to the Jetpack SDK, and think you are capable of running it via command line, then I hope that this will be a good starting point for you.

So you may be asking yourself "just wtf is cfx?" at this point.  Well, cfx is short for <strong>C</strong>uddle<strong>f</strong>ish e<strong>x</strong>ecuter iirc, but the point I want to make is that the name doesn't really matter, it was just a arbitrary name for the tool afaik.  However, cfx is the command-line tool provided by the Jetpack SDK that will allow you to build, run, and test add-ons that you develop with it, as well as allow you to access the documentation for the Jetpack SDK, and other packages that you may be using; so the name may not be important, but the tool is.  <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest" title="Jetpack SDK documentation" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for">The latest version of the documentation can be accessed here</a>, but you will be able to access the documentation of third party packages (more on what these are to come!) with the cfx command-line tool, so it's usually easier to read the documentation with the cfx tool imo.

<a target="_blank" title="Installing Jetpack SDK" rel="external" rev="vote-for" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/addon-development/installation.html">The instructions on how to install cfx</a> are here, and <a target="_blank" title="Using cfx - Jetpack SDK" rel="external" rev="vote-for" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/addon-development/cfx-tool.html">the instructions on how to use cfx are here</a>.   So I won't bore you with those details, but I suggest you read them over, so that you are ahead of the game for part 2 "how to build a addon".
