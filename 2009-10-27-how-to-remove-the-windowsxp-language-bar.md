I just want to briefly point out how to disable the <a rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306993">Windows XP language bar</a> from reappearing after every system restart, because it was bothering me for a long time. For some reason I assumed I would not be able to fix this for no good reason, and the pain wasn't so bad that I cared enough about it, but today I decided to look up how to do this and it was quite simple to do once the steps were laid out, so I wanted to pass this information along in case it helps someone else.
