				<p>At some point, the link that you had put into your web or bio spot on your Twitter profile or an update you sent out was classified by either Google or Firefox (or both) as having some form of malware attached to it. This means that most likely your website (or the website you linked to) was compromised by a hacker at some point. I've restored your account and deleted that link; once the site has been cleaned up, you're welcome to replace the link.</p>
				<p>Thanks!</p>

				<p>Hey guys,</p>
				<p>My account is suspended again?! what's going on?</p>
				<p>
					The hostmysite shared server my domain, erikvold.com was on was compromised.. it turns out that every site on the server was injected with javascript.
					They have move the site to another server, and I have cleaned the site by downloading the live files in to a working copy of the head on my svn repo, and reviewed the diffs, finding all of the injected javascript and removed it.
					So the site is clean, and I await news on the source of the compromise before deciding what to do, and then I will work on cleaning my rep with the security lists out there.. but my site should be clean, and I do not know why you need to continue suspending me, I am not pleased with this treatment..
				</p>
				<p>
					Regards,<br>
					Erik

				<p>We believe that you are no longer experiencing the issue that you were when you filed this ticket.  If you had found your account suspended, we suggest that you ensure that your following and unfollowing behavior is in line with the Twitter Rules and/or that you ensure that you were not linking to malware in your URL, location, or bio.  If you could not find yourself in search, we encourage you to wait a day and see if new updates are now resolving into search.  We also strongly encourage everyone to be aware of not only the Twitter Rules (<a rel="external nofollow" href="http://help.twitter.com/forums/26257/entries/18311%29" target="_blank">http://help.twitter.com/forums/26257/entries/18311)</a> but also the Best Practices for search (<a rel="external nofollow" href="http://help.twitter.com/forums/10713/entries/42646%29" target="_blank">http://help.twitter.com/forums/10713/entries/42646)</a>. </p>

					The links you provide do not explain why my account was suspended from June 25th to July 1st. Please explain, because I believe my following/unfollowing is normal, I simply follow people I want to follow once, and that's it, so the one hint you give doesn't make any sense..

					The reason you were suspended again (and nearly a third time) is that your link was not yet recognized as clean. In fact, it is still giving malware messages. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do to stop you from being flagged if that is the case. I would recommend having the site checked out again.

				<p>- "The reason you were suspended again (and nearly a third time) is that your link was not yet recognized as clean." this reason was only clearly given with initial response I received from delbius, where she also said "I've restored your account and deleted that link; once the site has been cleaned up, you're welcome to replace the link." and after this point my account was suspended a second time and the link was not in my bio, so excuse me but nobody has explained to me why my account was suspended the second time. Saying that the link in my bio was not clean is not a answer, because there was no link to my site in my bio during my second suspension.. This is the question I have been trying to get an answer for since June 25th.... </p>
				<p>- "In fact, it is still giving malware messages." from where? my site is clean at the moment I just checked again using the process I have already described.. further more google toolbar does not claim the site has malware on it anymore, which was the only service I was aware of my site being listed as malware on. </p>
				<p>- "I would recommend having the site checked out again." Just scanned my site again as I have already stated, and it is clean..... </p>

				<p>The account was definitely flagged as linking to malware. Could Firefox have flagged it? Either that or since you haven't actually been suspended again, there might just be some sort of technical error. </p>
				<p>Let us know if you have any more issues. Your account is active. </p>

				<strong>From Erik:</strong>
				<p>I realize now that it was a Firefox and not Google toolbar warning that I was referring to before, so my url must be off of the Firefox malware list. </p>
				<p>
				</p>
				<p>So I am baffled why twitter says my url is not clean.. and would appreciate some guidance with the issue. </p>
				<p>Identifying why my account was suspended the second time, on June 25th, is all I want to do.. as to avoid this very painful experience from happening again. I am 99.9% certain that the url in my bio was removed June 24th by delbius and it never changed back until I did so on July 1st. So as far as I can tell there is no reason provided to me as of yet as to why my account was suspended from June 25th to July 1st, during which time I could not follow people, others could not follow me, I could not post a status update, I could not use any twitter clients, and my profile page was vandalized. </p>

				<p>A response from badwarebusters.org: </p>
				<p>"Google shows your site to be clean. Firefox pulls from Google's list, so Firefox isn't a problem now. Stopbadware pulls from Google's list, which is probably why you can't Request a Review there since you aren't flagged right now by Google. </p>
				<p>I don't know what list Twitter uses, or if it is real-time. Have you checked their site help for information about how their warnings work? </p>
				<p>
				The last time Google visited this site was on 2009-06-29 and it was clear. Twitter may not be using the Google Safe Browsing list."
				<br>
				by Kaleh, the url is:
				<a target="_new" href="http://badwarebusters.org/main/itemview/5394">http://badwarebusters.org/main/itemview/5394</a>
				</p>
				<p>And I was mistaken about the date, it was June 29th that Google reviewed my site and cleared it. </p>

			I don't know if I will continue to tweet any longer now, and will certainly not recommend it to anyone, when users are treated so poorly on purpose.
