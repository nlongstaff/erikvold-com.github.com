title: The Daily UserScript: Move UserScript.org Groups Created/Joined Right

This userscript will move the groups created/joined lists to the right navigation which makes the groups page much easier to read.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
At <a title="Groups - Userscripts.org" rel="external" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="http://userscripts.org/groups">the current groups page at userscripts.org</a> all of the groups that you have joined or created are listed at the top of the page, pushing the table of all groups way down the page if you have &gt;10 groups joined/created.
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/59357" title="UserScript.org Move Your Groups Created/Joined Lists to the Right" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"UserScript.org Move Your Groups Created/Joined Lists to the Right" UserScript</a> these two lists of groups created/joined will be moved to the right navigation where there is currently a bunch of white space.
