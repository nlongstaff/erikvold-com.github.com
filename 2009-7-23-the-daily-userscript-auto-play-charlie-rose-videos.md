This userscript is simple, but fixes a little problem I have had with Charlie Rose's website.
</p>

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
When you go to a interview page on <a hrev="http://www.charlierose.com/" title="Charlie Rose" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank">charlierose.com</a> to watch an interview, you have to pick up the mouse and press play, sucks doesn't it?
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Now you don't have to press play any longer, monkeys take care of that for you.
