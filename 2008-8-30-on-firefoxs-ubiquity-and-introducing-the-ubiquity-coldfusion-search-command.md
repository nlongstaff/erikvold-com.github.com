title: On Firefox's Ubiquity and Introducing the Ubiquity Coldfusion Search Command

Well it doesn't happen often, but today it has happened again, I was blown away by another [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) extension, and even less frequently I'm blown away to a new level, well today is another one of those days, welcome [Ubiquity](http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/ubiquity-in-depth/). I recommend you read Aza Raskin's post, because it is well worth it. But my short summary of the Ubiquity extension is that you can easily make command's for firefox with javascript, and furthermore, it's extremely easy to share these commands, and send updates.

I've been playing with it for about 2 hours now, since I read Aza's post, and I have already have got my first command published, here it is:

* [Coldfusion](http://erikvold.com/tools/ubiquity/coldfusion/coldfusion.cfm): Searches the Coldfusion 8 LiveDocs for a term.

An example command would be:

coldfusion continue   

Which will show you some Coldfusion 8 LiveDocs results for "continue".

Enjoy!
