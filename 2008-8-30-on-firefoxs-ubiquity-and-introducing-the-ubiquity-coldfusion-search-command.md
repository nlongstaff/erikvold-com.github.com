Well it doesn't happen often, but today it has happened again, I was blown away by another <a title="Firefox Web Browser" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> extension, and even less frequently I'm blown away to a new level, well today is another one of those days, welcome <a title="Ubiquity In Depth by Aza Raskin" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/ubiquity-in-depth/">Ubiquity</a>. I recommend you read Aza Raskin's post, because it is well worth it. But my short summary of the Ubiquity extension is that you can easy make command's for firefox with javascript, and furthermore, it's extremely easy to share these commands, and send updates.</p>
<p>
I've been playing with it for about 2 hours now, since I read Aza's post, and I have already have got my first command published, here it is:
</p><ul>
<li><a title="Ubiquity Command to Search Coldfusion 8 LiveDocs" rel="code" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://erikvold.com/tools/ubiquity/coldfusion/coldfusion.cfm">coldfusion</a>: Searches the Coldfusion 8 LiveDocs for a term.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>
An example command would be:
</p><div class="code">coldfusion continue</div><p></p>

Which will show you some Coldfusion 8 LiveDocs results for "continue".

Enjoy!
