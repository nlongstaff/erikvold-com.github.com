Three days ago Google announced it's release of <a title="Goo.gl" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/">Goo.gl</a> a url shortener which is more reliable and trust worthy (to a user) than other services such as <a rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="tinyurl.com">tinyurl.com</a>, <a rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="http://tr.im/">tr.im</a>, <a rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a>, etc.
</p>
<p>
Now I think all web publishers should maintain their own url shortener which only they can create urls for and control, for example I bought the domain evold.ca, and use the subdomain r.evold.ca as my url shortener. I primarily use this domain to shorten urls to my other domains, like erikvold.com, but I can and do occasionally use it to create short urls for domains that are not mine. As a user, when I see a blog post that I want to share, I first check if the publisher has published a short url for the page, which any smart web publisher does, but for the other web publishers (the majority atm) I have to create a short url, which I can now use <a title="Goo.gl" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/">Goo.gl</a> to do.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that <a title="Goo.gl" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/">Goo.gl</a> does not allow users to use it to shorten links directly. <strong>Currently, the Google URL Shortener is only <i>officially</i> available via the Google Toolbar and FeedBurner</strong>.

Well, I noticed that this problem was solved yesterday by a <a rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/iblijlcdoidgdpfknkckljiocdbnlagk">Google Chrome extension called goo.gl shortener</a>. <a title="Amit Agarwal" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.labnol.org/about.html">Amit Agarwal</a> drew my attention to this extension in <a title="Create Google Short URLs without the Toolbar" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/create-google-short-url/11748/">a blog post he wrote yesterday</a>, where he pointed out the important javascript parts needed to create goo.gl short urls. So I took this information and opened Goo.gl up with <a title="Goo.gl Fix - UserScript" rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/64441">a userscript</a>, <a title="Goo.gl Ubiquity Command" rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://erikvold.com/tools/ubiquity/googl/index.cfm">a ubiquity command</a>, and <a title="Goo.gl Jetpack" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://jetpackgallery.mozillalabs.com/jetpacks/227">a jetpack</a> to help everyone create short urls with Goo.gl, check them out!
