<a title="Librivox" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://librivox.org/">Librivox</a> is an amazing website that I have been watching for a number of years now, and it helped me out enormously in those awful required Art classes I took while at <a title="University of British Columbia" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="http://ubc.ca/">UBC</a>. Now the site is far more interesting to me as I have some time to read what I wish, and because I find listening to audiobooks, and switching to reading every now and then to be the most efficient way for me to digest a non-technical book.

Librivox is basically just a repository of free audiobooks that were made for free by volunteer netizens like you and I. All you need is a computer with some recording software which is ubiquitous at this point, in fact the <a title="iPhone 3gs Voice Memo app - Apple" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3gs/voice-memos.html">iPhone Voice Memo app</a> (which is also available for the <a title="iPod Touch" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">iPod Touch</a>) is a great way to do this from the comfort of your favorite chair and couch.
