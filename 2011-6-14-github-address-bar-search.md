A couple of weeks ago <a title="Exploring social search with Twitter Address Bar Search" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="https://mozillalabs.com/prospector/2011/06/01/exploring-social-search-with-twitter-address-bar-search/">Mozilla Labs &amp; Twitter released a restartless Firefox add-on called "Twitter Address Bar Search"</a>, which actually did 3 main things:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Added a app tab for http://twitter.com/ if you did not already have one.</li>
  <li>Added a Twitter search engine.</li>
  <li>Added results to the address bar's suggestion list for you when you typed @username of #hash, which would allow you to save time whilst searching for @mentions or #hashes</li>
</ol>

<p>
Then <a title="Extensibly Awesome: A Jetpack API for the Firefox Location Bar" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://autonome.wordpress.com/2011/06/08/extensibly-awesome/">Dietrich partly ported the address bar mods to a add-on sdk module</a>. So I took his module, made some improvements, fixed some bugs, and whipped up a extension that does basically the same thing as the "Twitter Address Bar Search" add-on, but for Github, and made with the add-on sdk.

The "<a title="Github Address Bar Search" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-address-bar-search/">Github Address Bar Search</a>" add-on is the same as the "<a title="Twitter Address Bar Search" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-address-bar-search">Twitter Address Bar Search</a>" add-on, except it doesn't add a Github search engine, I leave that to you.
