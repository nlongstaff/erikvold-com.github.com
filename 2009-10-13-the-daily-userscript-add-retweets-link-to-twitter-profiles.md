title: The Daily UserScript: Add Retweets Link To Twitter Profiles

This userscript will add two links to all Twitter profiles which will display all tweets of or by the user displayed.

##The Unpleasantry:

Currently to view the retweets of or by a user we have to perform the search manually.

##The Alleviation:

Once you install the ["Twitter Add Retweets Link To Profiles" Userscript](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/59153) there will be two additional links displayed on each Twitter profile page, one for retweets by the user, and the other for retweets of the user's tweets.
