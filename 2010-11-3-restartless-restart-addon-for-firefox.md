I've always wished that Firefox had a "Restart" menu item, and because of that I've used the <a title="Quick Restart - AMO" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3559/">Quick Restart</a> Firefox add-on quite a bit in the past. At some point last year while the Jetpack prototype was still being developed I even wrote a jetpack to add the menu item in less than 50 lines for <a title="50 line Jetpack challenge" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/01/jetpack-50-line-code-challenge-winner-is-crowned/">a contest that Mozilla had</a>. I used that for a while, but these days I live on the FIrefox nightly (aka Minefield) and both of those old options aren't available to me any longer. So I decided to write a restartless add-on to add a "File" -&gt; "Restart" menu item to Firefox.

<p>I'm calling this add-on "<a title="Restartless Restart - AMO" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/249342/">Restartless Restart</a>" and it works on FIrefox 4+, it's 1KB at the moment, and it does not require a restart to be enabled, disabled, installed, or uninstalled. <a title="Restartless Restart - AMO" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/249342/">You can find it on addons.mozilla.org here</a>. If you want to contribute, then <a title="Restartless Restart - GitHub" rel="external" rev="vote-for" target="_blank" href="http://github.com/erikvold/restartless-restart-ffext">you can find the project on GitHub</a>, where all of my projects can be found.</p>
<p>
The part that I love most is that it's still less than 50 lines =]
