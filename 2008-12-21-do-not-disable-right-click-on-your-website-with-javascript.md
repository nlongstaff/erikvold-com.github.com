I'm just going to list some reasons why it's a bad idea to disable right clicking on your website with <a title="JavaScript" rev="vote-for" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">JavaScript</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any user can simply disable JavaScript, then view source, copy, etc, etc, without any trouble.</li>
<li>With tools such as <a title="NoScript - Firefox Addon" rev="vote-for" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722">NoScript</a> and <a title="Greasemonkey - Firefox Addon" rev="vote-for" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a>, users can disable your code automatically.</li>
<li>It's another reason for your users to remember "oh yeah that's why I hate you".</li>
<li>It's a waste of your time, and all of your users' time.</li>
<li>It's extra data that has to be downloaded, wasting electricity and time.</li>
</ul>

<p>So please <a title="How to Disable Right Click at your site / blog" rel="external nofollow" rev="vote-against" target="_blank" href="http://tendou86.blogspot.com/2008/08/how-to-disable-right-click-at-your-site.html">do not listen to people that suggest doing this</a>, it's a bad idea.</p>
