I'm just going to list some reasons why it's a bad idea to disable right clicking on your website with [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript).</p>


1. Any user can simply disable JavaScript, then view source, copy, etc, etc, without any trouble.
2. With tools such as <a title="NoScript - Firefox Addon" rev="vote-for" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722">[NoScript]and <a title="Greasemonkey - Firefox Addon" rev="vote-for" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a>, users can disable your code automatically.</li>
3 It's another reason for your users to remember "oh yeah that's why I hate you".
4 It's a waste of your time, and all of your users' time.
5 It's extra data that has to be downloaded, wasting electricity and time.
