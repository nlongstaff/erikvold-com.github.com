I'm just going to list some reasons why it's a bad idea to disable right clicking on your website with [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript).

1. Any user can simply disable JavaScript, then view source, copy, etc, etc, without any trouble.
2. With tools such as [NoScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript) and [Greasemonkey - Firefox Addon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript), users can disable your code automatically.
3. It's another reason for your users to remember "oh yeah that's why I hate you".
4. It's a waste of your time, and all of your users' time.
5. It's extra data that has to be downloaded, wasting electricity and time.

So please [do not listen to people that suggest doing this](http://tendou86.blogspot.com/2008/08/how-to-disable-right-click-at-your-site.html) it's a bad idea.
