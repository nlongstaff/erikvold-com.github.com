Today's userscript adds a current location button to Google Maps and is inspired by the current location button in the Maps app on the iPhone, albeit it's not as good.
</p>

<p>
There is already a default location preference to Google Maps, which I have set to the city I reside in the past, but it requires me to go to the Google Maps home page, which is another page to load. I am thinking about adding a default location button via userscript in the future to resolve this however, but the current location button userscript I have written today was a easier one to do, and had to be done for all mobile people in my opinion, and as a side effect it would free up the default location to be anything else.

<h2>The Unpleasantry:</h2>
<p>
Returning the map to my current location after browsing around requires going to the Google Maps homepage, and having my default location set to my current location.
</p>

<h2>The Alleviation:</h2>
<p>
Once you install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/57106" title="Google Maps Current Location" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" rev="vote-for">"Google Maps Current Location" UserScript</a> you will have a "Current Location" button beside the search button.
